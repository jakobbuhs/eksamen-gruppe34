            <h2>Key Terms</h2>
            <div id="topical-div1">Technological determinism: An idea that technology has a vast impact in our life. “Co-production/disruptive-technology”? 
            Research ethics: A way for developers to assess the risks and implications with a product that is developed. </div>
            <h3>Identify the Situation</h3>
            <div id="topical-div2">Todays society relies on the internet and with the satellite internet technology more people across the world can have access to a “larger part” of the world. 
                The case is relevant to society, technology and our future profession in a way that we bear responsibility with future innovations, 
                research and how we use technology, which Anders Braarud Hanssen introduce in module 1.4 (RRI) you can read more about this <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/responsible-research-innovation">here.</a> 
                It is therefore important to look at how previous and current innovations can or will affect our society to prevent unintended consequences. </div>
            <h4>Describe your immediate reactions</h4>
            <div id="topical-grid3">Satellite internet technology opens up for people in countries with limited freedom to access information outside of the national border, 
                and also for people living in rural areas where it's difficult to build ground internet. 
                It makes for a more stable connection than ground internet as it will not be affected by natural disasters. 
                Negative sides comes with it as the upload and download speeds will not be as fast as fiber. 
                It sounds great that more people can get access to the internet because it can be very useful in gathering information and connecting with people. </div>
            <h5>Make up your mind</h5>
            <div id="topical-grid4">We believe it will make society better because we live in a more digitalized world where everything is connected. 
                As discussed above, satellite internet has many potentially positive aspects, and although it may raise concerns for some regarding privacy and pollution, 
                satellite internet can be a great tool for our technologically developed world and connect even more people which could lead to even more advanced technology with less pollution. 
                We learn from history, and seeing how things turn out with Starlink and other satellite internets and other innovations as well, is important for the future of our society. </div>
